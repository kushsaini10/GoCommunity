## Goal Behind This Application 

This appication was made because there was a boundation in Pokémon Go that players cannot see the map beyond their view in game unless they start moving to other locations.
So, this app will help the community of Pokémon Go players to mark in-game locations on map in the app and let other players see locations beyond their region.
